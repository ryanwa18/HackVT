# HackVT-2016
This was a small weekend project that a friend and I completed at the Virginia Tech Hackathon 2016. This is an android application that gives users information about parking schedules on the Virginia Tech campus. The application is a simple database of different parking areas on campus which is then viewable within the user interface.
